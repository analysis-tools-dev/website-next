As a developer, I have faced my fair share of security mishaps. I recall times
when I accidentally exposed sensitive data in logs or sent a network request
over a non-encrypted HTTP channel when HTTPS was available. I'm sure many of you
can relate to these situations. We may not be security experts, but that doesn't
mean we shouldn't take measures to protect our applications. This is where
Bearer, a new security tool for Ruby and JavaScript apps (Java coming soon),
comes into play.

## Security for Everyone

Bearer aims to make security accessible to all developers, even those without
expertise in the field. By detecting potential security issues before they reach
production, either directly on the CLI or during the CI/CD process, Bearer
simplifies the process of securing your application. With a very low false
positive rate and a swift scan process, you can focus on addressing real issues
rather than chasing ghosts.

## Sensitive data, sorted by impact

Is an SQL injection more critical than an XSS vulnerability? With Bearer
sensitive data context, you might change your perspective on prioritization.

Indeed, what sets Bearer apart is its ability to detect sensitive data flows
(PII, PD, PHI) and link those to the different risks and vulnerabilities found.
It automatically prioritizes findings that will have a critical impact on your
application and business, essentially to prevent data breaches and data leaks.

A nice add-on to the tool is its ability to generate a privacy report, plus it
works with most languages (_Ruby, JS, Java, C#, Python, Go_).

## Empowering Developers with Actionable Insights

In addition to showing what matters first to developers, Bearer provides
documented examples of why a particular issue is problematic and how to fix it.
This empowers developers to secure their apps in just a few minutes and fosters
a better understanding of security best practices.

## Integration and Open Source

With support for both GitHub and GitLab, Bearer easily integrates into your
existing workflow. The project was recently open-sourced, allowing you to
contribute to its development and stay up-to-date with the latest features.
Check it out on GitHub at https://github.com/bearer/bearer.
