We found that static code analysis is a topic that is attracting a lot of engineers, which care about code-quality and solid engineering standards. Our goal is to create an open community for developers that want to take their code and skill set to the next level.

We want this to be a community project. All code is [on Github](https://github.com/analysis-tools-dev) and we foster collaboration. If you're willing to help, head over to our Github organization, where we organize our work.

If you like to sponsor the project, please [Check out our Github Sponsors page here](https://github.com/sponsors/analysis-tools-dev/)!
