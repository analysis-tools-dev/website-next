Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a method of serializing structured data.

It is useful in developing programs to communicate with each other over a wire or for storing data.  The method involves an interface description language that describes the structure of some data and a program that generates source code from that description for generating or parsing a stream of bytes that represents the structured data.

Google developed Protocol Buffers for internal use and provided a code generator for multiple languages under an open source license (see below).
