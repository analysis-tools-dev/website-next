Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by
Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically similar to C,
but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style
concurrency. The language is often referred to as "Golang" because of its domain
name, golang.org, but the proper name is Go.
